## SMTP Status Codes

The [current SMTP standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321) defines the response codes but they are applied differently between SMTP servers. Not every mail server is configured in the same way and thus there *will* be differences in how mail delivery failures are interpreted.

:::tip[Remember]
Because no two SMTP servers are alike, a “mailbox unavailable” response on one server may be a “message rejected” error on another!

<details>
<summary>General Status Codes</summary>

SMTP codes that start with 2 and 3 are general status messages that are sent in reply to requests from the sending server. They do not indicate errors in the mail delivery but are used as prompts in the exchange between the mail servers.

| **SMTP code** | **Description**                                                                         | **Meaning**                                                                                           |

<summary>Temporary SMTP Error Codes</summary>

SMTP 400 codes are transient errors and are usually related to issues at the receiving mail server. Messages are returned as a soft bounce and the sender may try again after, for example, reducing the size of the attachments in the email.

| **SMTP code** | **Description**                                         | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 421           | Service not available, closing transmission channel     | The receiving server or sending server is not reachable but another mail delivery will be attempted. If you are using a remote server like MailerSend's SMTP relay to send emails, test that you can connect to it successfully. Otherwise, you may wish to check the receiving server’s availability.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 450           | Requested mail action not taken: mailbox unavailable    | This error could mean that the recipient does not exist, the mailbox does not have permission to receive the email, or the message was rejected due to a blocklist or filter.  <br>  <br>To fix this, you should confirm the recipient’s email address, see if [your IP address is on a blocklist](https://www.mailercheck.com/articles/email-blocklist-removal), test your email for spam-like content, or try sending an email without an attachment. |
| 451           | Requested action aborted: error in processing           | The receiving server is unable to process the message due to [email authentication rules](https://www.mailersend.com/blog/email-authentication). For example, if Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is being used, you should confirm that a DNS lookup can be made for your sending domain and that the domain’s name server is functioning properly.                                                                                                       |
| 452           | Requested action not taken: insufficient system storage | The receiving server is overwhelmed by too many messages being sent at once or is out of memory or storage space. Review your sending rate by looking at your mail-sending queue and logs, or inform the server’s mail administrator about the storage and free memory issues.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 455           | Server unable to accommodate the parameters             | The server cannot process the command at this time. You can retry after waiting a while or contact the receiving server’s mail administrator if the error persists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

<summary>Permanent SMTP Error Codes</summary>

SMTP 500 reply codes are mail delivery errors of a permanent nature that are usually caused by the sender. The receiving server returns the message as a hard bounce and prefers that the sender not try again unless the problem is fixed.

The 500 series starts with errors in issuing SMTP commands like the following examples:

| **SMTP code** | **Description**                         | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 500           | Syntax error, command unrecognized      | The receiving server does not recognize the command. If your server is using antivirus or firewall software, try disabling them before sending the message again.                                                                  |
| 501           | Syntax error in parameters or arguments | The command is recognized but there are errors with its options or command arguments. This server error is sometimes returned for an invalid or incorrect email! But it may be due to your antivirus or firewall software as well. |
| 502           | Command not implemented                 | The command is currently not supported on the receiving server. Review your sending commands as well as your MTA’s configuration.                                                                                                  |
| 503           | Bad sequence of commands                | The receiving server recognizes the command but its parameters or options are in the wrong sequence. This sometimes appears when the email account is not authenticated. Do review your MTA’s configuration as well.               |
| 504           | Command parameter not implemented       | Similar to 502, the command is recognized but its parameters or options are not supported on the receiving server. You may wish to review your sending commands as well as your MTA’s configuration.                               |
| 521           | Server does not accept mail             | The server does not receive or send mail. This may be because the server is part of a mail relay. The email may fail or be relayed to another mail server. Check if the email has been delivered to confirm.                       |

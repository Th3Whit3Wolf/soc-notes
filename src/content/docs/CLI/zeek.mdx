## What is ZEEK?

Today, Zeek is supported by several developers, and Corelight provides an Enterprise-ready fork of Zeek. Therefore this tool is called both open source and commercial.
The differences between the open-source version and the commercial version are detailed here.

Zeek differs from known monitoring and IDS/IPS tools by providing a wide range of detailed logs ready to investigate both for forensics and data analysis actions.
Currently, Zeek provides 50+ logs in 7 categories.

### Zeek vs Snort

While both are called IDS/NIDS, it is good to know the cons and pros of each tool and use them in a specific manner. While there are some overlapping functionalities, they have different purposes for usage.

### Zeek Architecture

Zeek has two primary layers; "Event Engine" and "Policy Script Interpreter". The Event Engine layer is where the packets are processed; it is called the event core and is responsible for describing the event without focusing on event details. It is where the packages are divided into parts such as source and destination addresses, protocol identification, session analysis and file extraction. The Policy Script Interpreter layer is where the semantic analysis is conducted. It is responsible for describing the event correlations by using Zeek scripts.

### Zeek Frameworks

Zeek has several frameworks to provide extended functionality in the scripting layer. These frameworks enhance Zeek's flexibility and compatibility with other network components. Each framework focuses on the specific use case and easily runs with Zeek installation. For instance, we will be using the "Logging Framework" for all cases. Having ide on each framework's functionality can help users quickly identify an event of interest. 

**Available Frameworks**

| Logging   | Notice               | Input      | Configuration   | Intelligence   |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cluster   | Broker Communication | Supervisor | GeoLocation     | File Analysis  |
| Signature | Summary              | NetControl | Packet Analysis | TLS Decryption |

You can read more on frameworks [**here**](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/index.html). 

### Zeek Outputs  

As mentioned before, Zeek provides 50+ log files under seven different categories, which are helpful in various areas such as traffic monitoring, intrusion detection, threat hunting and web analytics. This section is not intended to discuss the logs in-depth. The logs are covered in **TASK 3**.  

Once you run Zeek, it will automatically start investigating the traffic or the given pcap file and generate logs automatically. Once you process a pcap with Zeek, it will create the logs in the working directory. If you run the Zeek as a service, your logs will be located in the default log path. The default log path is:` /opt/zeek/logs/ `

### Working with Zeek

There are two operation options for Zeek. The first one is running it as a service, and the second option is running the Zeek against a pcap. Before starting working with Zeek, let's check the version of the Zeek instance with the following command: `zeek -v`

Now we are sure that we have Zeek installed. Let's start the Zeek as a service! To do this, we need to use the "ZeekControl" module, as shown below. The "ZeekControl" module requires superuser permissions to use. You can elevate the session privileges and switch to the superuser account to examine the generated log files with the following command: `sudo su`

Here we can manage the Zeek service and view the status of the service. Primary management of the Zeek service is done with three commands; "status", "start", and "stop". 

#### ZeekControl Module

```bash
root@ubuntu$ zeekctl
Welcome to ZeekControl 2.X.0
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped
[ZeekControl] > start
starting zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     running   2541   13 Mar 18:25:08
[ZeekControl] > stop
stopping zeek ...
[ZeekControl] > status
Name         Type       Host          Status    Pid    Started
zeek         standalone localhost     stopped     
```

You can also use the "ZeekControl" mode with the following commands as well;  

- `zeekctl status`
- `zeekctl start`
- `zeekctl stop`

## Zeek Logs

Zeek generates log files according to the traffic data. You will have logs for every connection in the wire, including the application level protocols and fields. Zeek is capable of identifying 50+ logs and categorising them into seven categories. Zeek logs are well structured and tab-separated ASCII files, so reading and processing them is easy but requires effort. You should be familiar with networking and protocols to correlate the logs in an investigation, know where to focus, and find a specific piece of evidence.

Each log output consists of multiple fields, and each field holds a different part of the traffic data. Correlation is done through a unique value called "UID". The "UID" represents the unique identifier assigned to each session.

Please refer to [Zeek's official documentation](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/log-files.html) and [Corelight log cheat sheet](https://corelight.com/about-zeek/zeek-data) for more information. Although there are multiple log files, some log files are updated daily, and some are updated in each session. Some of the most commonly used logs are explained in the given table.

| **Update Frequency** | **Log Name**         | **Description**                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Daily**            | *known_hosts.log*    | List of hosts that completed TCP handshakes.    |
| **Daily**            | *known_services.log* | List of services used by hosts.                 |
| **Daily**            | *known_certs.log*    | List of SSL certificates.                       |
| **Daily**            | *software.log*       | List of software used on the network.           |
| **Per Session**      | *notice.log*         | Anomalies detected by Zeek.                     |
| **Per Session**      | *intel.log*          | Traffic contains malicious patterns/indicators. |
| Per Session          | *signatures.log*     | List of triggered signatures.                   |

This is too much protocol and log information! Yes, it is true; a difficulty of working with Zeek is having the required network knowledge and investigation mindset. Don't worry; you can have both of these and even more knowledge by working through TryHackMe paths. Just keep the streak! 

### Brief log usage primer table

| **Overall Info**      | **Protocol Based** | **Detection**    | **Observation**       |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| *conn.log*            | *http.log*         | *notice.log*     | *known\_host.log*     |
| *files.log*           | *dns.log*          | *signatures.log* | *known\_services.log* |
| *intel.log*           | *ftp.log*          | *pe.log*         | *software.log*        |
| *loaded\_scripts.log* | *ssh.log*          | *traceroute.log* | *weird.log*           |

You can categorise the logs before starting an investigation. Thus, finding the evidence/anomaly you are looking for will be easier. The given table is a brief example of using multiple log files. You can create your working model or customise the given one. Make sure you read each log description and understand the purpose to know what to expect from the corresponding log file. Note that these are not the only ones to focus on. Investigated logs are highly associated with the investigation case type and hypothesis, so do not just rely only on the logs given in the example table!

The table shows us how to use multiple logs to identify anomalies and run an investigation by correlating across the available logs.

- **Overall Info:** The aim is to review the overall connections, shared files, loaded scripts and indicators at once. This is the first step of the investigation.
- **Protocol Based:** Once you review the overall traffic and find suspicious indicators or want to conduct a more in-depth investigation, you focus on a specific protocol.
- **Detection:** Use the prebuild or custom scripts and signature outcomes to support your findings by having additional indicators or linked actions.
- **Observation:** The summary of the hosts, services, software, and unexpected activity statistics will help you discover possible missing points and conclude the investigation.

  
Remember, we mention the pros and cons of the Zeek logs at the beginning of this task. Now let's demonstrate the log viewing and identify the differences between them.
